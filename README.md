# Homoscedasticity Assumption in Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the most commonly used techniques for modeling the relationship between input variables and a continuous target variable. However, linear regression relies on several key assumptions, one of which is homoscedasticity.

In this write-up, I will discuss:
* What the homoscedasticity assumption is
* How to identify whether a dataset meets the homoscedasticity assumption
* What to do if a dataset violates the homoscedasticity assumption
